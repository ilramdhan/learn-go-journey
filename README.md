## 🚀 How to Run

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- Install [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) in your system.

### ▶️ Run Directly with Go

Navigate to the project folder you want to run and execute:

```bash
go run filename.go
```

Replace `filename.go` with the actual file name, for example:

```bash
go run invest_calculator.go
```

### 🛠️ Run Built Executable

If you have already built the project:

```bash
./filename.exe
```

Replace `filename.exe` with the actual executable file name.

## 💡 Notes

- The `.idea` folders contain IDE settings and can be ignored if not using GoLand.  
- These projects are created purely for learning purposes. Contributions, suggestions, and improvements are welcome.
